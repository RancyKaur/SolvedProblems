### Practice Problem Solving

This repository contains code files for the problems that I have been working on.

This repository has code written in Python, there is another repository that has solution in Java

#### Categories

So I have been solving problems to get a hang of techniques
I attempt to first solve by brute-force and then try other techniques

Obvious intent is to compare and improvise either time or space complexity

1. Strings/Arrays
2. Linked List
3. Stacks
4. Trees
5. Sorting/Searching
6. Maths & Logic

Questions are attempted from CtCI book and coding sites like leetcode/hackerrank
